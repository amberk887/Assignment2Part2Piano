Welcome to the Piano App! 
This app let's the user select a root note and then takes the user to a new screen where a list of card views displays all of the chords that originate from that root. 
The API that our group used was https://rapidapi.com/jsdisco/api/piano-chords/
A little about the developers:
The three of us are Computer Science students who are really passionate about music and coding! 
We hope you enjoy the app!
